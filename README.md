# CRM Programmer School
***


The `CRM Programmer School API` is a RESTful API designed to manage the operations and data of a programmer school 
focused on customer relationship management. It provides endpoints for managing students, courses, and other related entities.
By utilizing this API, you can `effortlessly` retrieve comprehensive information about all orders and perform various operations on them.
The API provides robust filtering capabilities, allowing you to narrow down your search based on specific properties or criteria.
This ensures that you have the flexibility to access the precise order data you need, optimizing your productivity.
In addition, the API documentation is carefully prepared to help developers easily integrate and use the API in their projects.

>Note that this is only the backend of the project. The client part of the project can be found here [FRONT](https://github.com/Orest-Sabara/crm-frontend)
